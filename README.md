mined-per-day
=============


<del>REQUIRES Requests - docs.python-requests.org</del>
EDIT: Requests has now been added to the repository for convenience. 


Calculates how much money is mined each day by various altcoins.

The goal of this project is to create a Google App Engine Script that tracks the daily mining revenue of various altcoins. This repo contains the google app engine files, and the application is running at <b><a href="http://minedperday.appspot.com">minedperday.appspot.com</a></b> . In the future the script will hopefully track more data points.
