mined-per-day
=============

Calculates how much money is mined each day by various altcoins.

The goal of this project is to take what was once a Google App Engine Script and turn it into a standalone application that tracks various altcoins. The original script (commits 1 and 2) tracked the amount of USD mined each day by various altcoins, then ranked altcoins by that value. This is still running at minedperday.appspot.com . In the future the script will hopefully track more data points.
